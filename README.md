## Real-Time Face Recognition 

 1. Face Detection - Using OpenCV Haar feature-based cascade classifiers
  
 2. Data Gathering - Gather face data (images) of the persons to be identified than create a dataset
  
 3. Train the Recognizer - Feed the face data and respective id's of each face to the recognizer so that it can learn
  
 4. Recognition - Recognizer predicts its id and an index, shown how confident the recognizer is with this match
